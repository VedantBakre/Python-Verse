# Input: Basic Pay
basic_pay = float(input("Enter Basic Pay: "))

# Allowances
da = 0.80 * basic_pay   # Dearness Allowance
hra = 0.10 * basic_pay  # House Rent Allowance
ta = 0.05 * basic_pay   # Travel Allowance

# Gross Salary
gross_salary = basic_pay + da + hra + ta

# Professional Tax Deduction
professional_tax = 0.02 * gross_salary

# Net Salary (Salary Payable)
net_salary = gross_salary - professional_tax

# Output
print("\n--- Salary Details ---")
